# GameHub

GameHub is a video game discovery web app that showcases and helps you find interesting games to play. With GameHub, you can search for games by platform, genre, and more.

## Deployed

The GameHub project is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and the link to the production site is [GameHub](https://game-hub-wine-omega.vercel.app/)

This is the project I built by following Mosh Hamedani's Ultimate React course.
